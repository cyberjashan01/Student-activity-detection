**Teachable Machine AI Webcam Demo**

This project shows how to use machine learning in a web application with Teachable Machine and TensorFlow.js. It lets users interact with a pre-trained AI model that can classify objects or gestures from a live webcam feed, making it easy to see AI in action.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time object or gesture classification using your webcam.
- Displays predictions with confidence scores.
- Clean, responsive design with animated background effects.
- Countdown before the webcam starts.
- Built using Teachable Machine and TensorFlow.js for smooth machine learning performance.

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- TensorFlow.js
- Teachable Machine API
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

**How it Works:**
1. Click the "Start Webcam" button to begin the webcam feed.
2. The AI model loads and starts classifying whatever is captured by the webcam.
3. The predicted labels and their confidence levels are shown in real-time.
4. The user interface is designed to be easy to use and looks great on all devices.

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone or download the repository to your computer.
2. Open the HTML file in a browser to start using the webcam and see live AI predictions.
